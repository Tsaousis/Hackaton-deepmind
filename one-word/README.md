# ONE WORD

> Change one word. Change the world.

Each level has one rule sentence, e.g. `YOU [DIE] ON RED`. Click the highlighted word, type a
replacement (`hide`), and the world obeys the new sentence. Reach the exit.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # static build in dist/ (works on any static host / Hugging Face Spaces)
npm test         # brute-force solver: proves which words solve each level
```

Controls: **WASD / arrows** move · **Space** wait · **Enter / E** edit the word · **R** restart · **Esc** menu · **`** debug overlay.

## How words become mechanics

1. `LocalWordInterpreter`: dictionary + stemming (`protect` → HELP, `sleeping` → SLEEP).
2. AI interpreter (optional): only for words the dictionary doesn't know. **Gemini** (`GeminiWordInterpreter`,
   `responseSchema`) when a Gemini key is set, otherwise **OpenAI** (`OpenAIWordInterpreter`, `json_schema`).
   Output is constrained to the level's allowed tokens (or NONE) and re-validated. It never generates code, and any
   failure falls back to "the world doesn't understand".

The game is fully playable without AI.

### Dynamic mode (invented mechanics)

The title screen offers two modes next to **PLAY**: **NORMAL** (the twelve shipped mechanics, works with AI off)
and **DYNAMIC**, which needs an AI key. In dynamic mode verb slots stop being a menu and the dictionary is
skipped entirely — `vanish` no longer collapses onto `HIDE`, it becomes `VANISH` with a meaning of its own:
the model answers with a *mechanic spec* — data describing what a tile does and how an actor moves —
and the simulation runs it. `warp`, `melt`, `ghost` and `shadow` become real laws of the world although nobody
implemented them.

The spec is the safety boundary. A mechanic is:

```ts
{ tile:   { onEnter: [{ do: 'teleport', target: 'EXIT' }], status: ['phasing'] },
  motion: { mode: 'trail', target: 'OBJECT', lethal: false, steps: 2 } }
```

`do` is one of nine verbs the engine implements (`die`, `kill`, `freeze`, `push`, `teleport`, `swap`, `unlock`,
`heal`, `nothing`), `mode` one of four ways to move. Model output is parsed by `parseSpec`, which drops unknown
fields, clamps numbers, caps action lists and refuses specs that say nothing at all — so a hallucination becomes
a dull tile, never a crash. Nothing is compiled and nothing is evaluated: no `eval`, no generated code, and a
typed word can never redefine a mechanic the game ships with. Each accepted word is cached for the session, so
the world keeps its mind and stays deterministic enough for the solver.

The twelve original mechanics are written in the same DSL (`src/rules/builtinSpecs.ts`) and get no privileges:
`npm test` still proves the shipped levels have exactly the documented solutions, through the spec interpreter.

### AI keys

- **Dev:** `cp .env.example .env.local` and set `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` ([Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey))
  and/or `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`. `.env.local` is gitignored and only read in dev mode. `npm run build` never includes
  it (`tools/check-no-keys.mjs` fails the build if a key shows up in `dist/`).
- **Deployed build:** click "AI interpreter: OFF" on the title screen and paste either key (OpenAI keys start with
  `sk-`). It stays in that browser's localStorage. (For a public demo, a small proxy server is the safer option.)
- Models: `VITE_GEMINI_MODEL` (default `gemini-3.8-flash`), `VITE_OPENAI_MODEL` (default `gpt-4.1-mini`).

## Levels

| # | Rule | Solutions |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | YOU **DIE** ON RED | HIDE, HEAL, BOUNCE |
| 2 | GUARD **CHASES** YOU | SLEEP, FLEE, FOLLOW |
| 3 | GUARD **CHASES** YOU (+ plate & door) | HELP, FOLLOW |
| 4 | GUARD CHASES **YOU** | KEY |
| 5 | GUARD **CHASES** YOU · YOU DIE ON RED | HELP, FLEE, FOLLOW |
| 6 | GUARD **CHASES** YOU · **YOU** DIE ON RED | timed: lure the guard onto red, then YOU → GUARD |
| 7 | GUARD **CHASES** YOU · **EVERYONE** DIES ON RED · YOU **FREEZE** ON BLUE | timed: EVERYONE → YOU, then CHASES → HELPS |
| 8 | YOU **DIE** ON RED · GUARD **CHASES** YOU (`maxChanges: 2`) | HIDE + HELP, HEAL + HELP, BOUNCE + HELP |

**The ONE WORD rule:** a level may have several editable words, but only one may differ from the original
sentences at a time. Rewriting another word restores the first. A level can raise this with `maxChanges`
(level 8 allows two).

**Timed levels** (`timed: true`): rewrites take effect instantly (a guard standing on a tile that just became
deadly dies), so *when* you change a word matters. For these levels `npm test` checks that no word typed at the
start works, and that a solution rewriting words mid-level exists.

`npm test` checks this table by exhaustive search over every allowed word (within `maxChanges`), then checks
that invented mechanics behave (`tests/dynamic.test.ts`).

### Add your own

One file = one level, in `src/levels/definitions/`, named `NN-slug.ts`. Drop a new file in and it
appears in the game and in the test run — there is no list to register it in.

**With the editor (easiest):** `npm run dev`, then **MAKE A LEVEL** on the title screen (or
<http://localhost:5173/editor.html>). Paint the map, tick the words players may change (one or
several), hit **TEST LEVEL** (it brute-forces every combination and fills in `solutions`), then
**SAVE TO definitions/** — the dev server writes the file and the game reloads with your level.
On a deployed static build the same button downloads the `.ts` file to drop into the folder (and
send as a pull request).

**By hand:**

```bash
cp src/levels/definitions/01-red.ts src/levels/definitions/07-my-level.ts
npm run dev
npm test
```

See `src/levels/definitions/README.md` for the level format, the map legend and the rule vocabulary.

## Structure

- `src/systems/World.ts`: deterministic turn-based simulation (no Phaser), specs → behavior
- `src/rules/MechanicSpec.ts`: the mechanic DSL, its validator and the JSON schema the model answers with
- `src/rules/`: rule types, sentence rendering, interpreters, `RuleManager`
- `src/levels/definitions/`: one file per level (auto-discovered, ordered by file number)
- `src/levels/levels.ts`: level discovery; `defineLevel.ts` / `registry.ts`: level format and loading
- `src/systems/Solver.ts`: brute-force solver, used by `npm test` and the editor's TEST LEVEL
- `src/editor/` + `editor.html`: visual level editor; `tools/levelWriterPlugin.ts` writes the file in dev
- `src/scenes/`: Phaser menu + game rendering
- `src/ui/`: DOM rule editor, level-complete card, sound
